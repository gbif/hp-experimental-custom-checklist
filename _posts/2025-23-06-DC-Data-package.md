A proposal for a Vocabulary Enhancement to the Darwin Core standard,  is scheduled for full **public review beginning 2025-09-01.** [Click here to access repository.](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/)

The public review will include a [Darwin Core Conceptual Model](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/#darwin-core-conceptual-model) as a component of a long-awaited Semantic Layer for Darwin Core and a [Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) Publishing Model](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/#darwin-core-data-package-dwc-dp-publishing-model) that implements the conceptual model and supports sharing deeper and richer data than is possible with a [Darwin Core Archive](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/dwca-guide). The Semantic Layer will define the explicit relationships between the classes that are seen in DwC-DP and will be based on the understanding of biodiversity-related concepts accumulated in the analysis of myriad use cases during the theoretical Unified Model phase of the project [Diversifying the GBIF Data Model.](https://www.gbif.org/new-data-model)

Previous to the public review, we welcome those who are interested to explore the Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) Publishing Model. **This is an opportunity to test the data publishing model with your real data. This community testing phase will remain open until 2025-08-01.**

# Participating and Getting Help #

In anticipation of a formal public review, scheduled to begin 2025-09-01, we would like to invite people to gain familiarity with and test the DwC-DP by attempting to map original datasets to it. We are just beginning to work on the “Darwin Core Data Package Guide”, which is intended to contain various “recipes” for publishing different types of datasets. Until that document contains useful content, the best way forward is to look at an already-mapped example dataset that is similar to the one you want to test [gbif/dwc-dp-examples](gbif/dwc-dp-examples). This community testing phase will remain open until 2025-08-01.
