*New quick start guide outlines steps for using the Humboldt Extension to upgrade and enrich existing datasets derived from structured ecological inventories*

Ecological monitoring data, whether gathered through traditional on-the-ground surveys or emerging approaches around sensor networks,
forms the gold standard for understanding biodiversity on a changing planet. However, the lack of a standardized way of collecting such
essential information about methods has limited its reuse, leaving researchers and practitioners unable to leverage the power of survey
datasets to monitor changing biodiversity trends.

[**Survey and Monitoring Data Quick-Start Guide:** A how-to for updating a Darwin Core dataset using the Humboldt Extension](https://docs.gbif.org/survey-monitoring-quick-start/en/) takes a key step toward closing this gap. Authored by GBIF programme officer for science support
[**Kate Ingenloff**](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5942-9053) with contributions from data administrator [**Cecilie Svenningsen**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9216-2917)
and members of the [Humboldt Extension task group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-extension/), 
this reference provides practical guidance that enables existing data publishers to help meet the growing demand for more structured, 
interoperable and reusable survey and monitoring datasets.

In early 2024, [Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)](https://www.tdwg.org/) ratified the Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories, 
the product of a multi-year community effort to enhance the utility of the [Darwin Core (DwC)](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/) standard, 
the most widely adopted exchange format for biodiversity data. 

The standardized vocabulary of 55 new terms that Humboldt introduces allows data publishers to capture consistent contextual information about
survey and monitoring activities and maximize the reusability of the resulting records. Efforts underway within the GBIF Secretariat will
significantly improve discovery, access and comparison of datasets available through GBIF.org.
