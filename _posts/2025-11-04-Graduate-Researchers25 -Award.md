**Call for nominations to the 2025 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award** 

The call is now open for the [GBIF 2025 Graduate Researchers Award](https://www.gbif.org/news/4AAE2KOKBRJ0iS2DE2fT65/call-for-nominations-opens-for-2025-gbif-graduate-researchers-award). The award fosters innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students in master’s and doctorate programmes at universities, whose studies rely on GBIF mediated data, in countries participating in the GBIF network.

The 2025 programme will provide €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers preferably, one master’s and one PhD candidate—nominated by the Heads of Delegation and Node Managers from [GBIF Participant countries.](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network)

South Africa, as a GBIF Participant Country, will nominate two candidates selected from the national applications submitted to the SANBI-GBIF Node until 24 May 2025. This selection will be supported through the newly established SANBI-GBIF Graduate Researcher Award Advisory Panel. The Department of Science and Innovation will engage with the SANBI-GBIF Node in submission of the two South African applicants to GBIF. 

A jury organized by the [GBIF Science Committee](https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=scienceCommittee) will select two award recipients from the pool of nominees whose names are received by the GBIF Secretariat by 27 June 2025. The winners will be announced at the 32nd meeting of the GBIF Governing Board (GB32) planned for Bogota, Colombia on 18-20 October 2025.

**Eligibility**

Candidates must be enrolled in a university graduate programme to be eligible for the award. Candidates must be either South African citizens or citizens of another country but students in a South African institution. Nominations can come from the GBIF delegation or node of either the candidate's country of citizenship or the country of the candidate’s host institution. 

**Submission process and deadlines**

Candidates should submit their application, together with completed documentation by email, to <F.Parker@sanbi.org.za> by **24 May 2025.** Submissions of incomplete proposals will not be considered.

**Award nomination packet**

Candidates should prepare their proposal and nomination packets to include:
1. **Research summary** (200 words)
 
2. **Project description** (maximum 5 pages, 12-point Arial) that describes
 
   a. How the research advances biodiversity informatics and/or the conservation of biological diversity.
   
   b. The role of data accessed through GBIF in addressing these questions. Research proposals must clearly 
      demonstrate  how the study incorporates data mobilized through GBIF. Students with questions about GBIF-enabled 
      data should work with academic advisors, their GBIF national node, the GBIF Secretariat or members of the 
      Science Committee to increase their understanding.
   
   c. The research scope, plan, methodologies, relevant literature citations and  timetable.
   
   d. If relevant, a description or an excerpt from a data management plan that outlines how data related to 
      the research is published or will be prepared for publication through the GBIF network to GBIF.org.
   
3. **Curriculum vitae** of the student applicant including full contact information at the home institution.
 
4. **Supporting documents**

    a. An official letter from the student’s faculty mentor/supervisor certifying that the applicant is a student in 
      good standing in the graduate programme of the university.
      
    b. At least one, and no more than three, letters of support from established researchers active in a field that 
      encompasses and incorporates biodiversity informatics (e.g., genetics, species composition and traits, 
      biogeography, ecology, systematics, etc.).

**Selection process and criteria**

The [GBIF Science Committee](https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=scienceCommittee) will review the nominations and select winners of the Graduate Researchers Awards. The criteria for the awards include:
• Originality and innovation
• Use of and strategic significance for data accessed through GBIF
• Measurable effectiveness and impact in advancing biodiversity informatics and/or the conservation of biological 
 diversity

Proposals that are not selected may be updated and resubmitted for consideration in subsequent years. Awardees are expected to acknowledge GBIF support when disseminating research results via peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional meetings, and other media.

SANBI-GBIF looks forward to receiving your applications.
