**Call for nominations to the 2025 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award** 

*Deadline for GBIF member countries to nominate graduate students whose innovative research relies on biodiversity data: 27 June 2025*

On behalf of its network of national [Voting and Associate Participants](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network), the GBIF Secretariat is pleased to invite nominations for the [2025 Graduate Researchers Award](https://www.gbif.org/graduate-researchers-award). This annual programme aims to highlight innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master's and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data.

The 2025 programme will provide two €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers. Candidates receive formal nominations from the node managers and heads of delegation from GBIF Participant countries, who generally select one master’s and one PhD candidate whose nominations are then forwarded to the GBIF Secretariat.

An expert jury coordinated through GBIF Science Committee will then select two award recipients from the pool of nominees whose names are received by the GBIF Secretariat by Friday, 27 June 2025 (23:59 UTC+2). The GBIF Secretariat will announce winners prior to the 32nd meeting of the GBIF Governing Board (GB32), on 18-20 October 2025 in Bogotá, Colombia, and present their work at that meeting.
