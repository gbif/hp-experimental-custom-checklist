**Venue: Biological Station Drøbak, Norway, Oslo**

**Date: 3–14 November 2025**

##Deadline for submissions: 13th August 2025##

BioDATA Advanced is an international project between Norway and South Africa that aims to support students in upper education in developing skills in biodiversity data management and publishing, 
in addition to the most modern molecular methods for monitoring biodiversity. The skills taught within BioDATA Advanced are important for carrying out the everyday tasks of a modern biologist, 
though many of these skills are not taught in higher education.

This project also looks to strengthen the partnership between the South African Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (SANBI-GBIF) and the other BioDATA Advanced partners,
through exchanges and enhanced collaborations on scientific projects of mutual interest.

**Scope**

The scope of the course is to provide participants with practical, hands-on experience in the full workflow of environmental DNA (eDNA) research, from field collection to data analysis. 
The training will cover sampling eDNA from aquatic environments, performing DNA extraction and lab work, sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform, and conducting bioinformatics analysis 
for interpretation of results. The course will emphasize immersive, community-based learning, fostering a strong collaborative environment.
